       <h2>What is the Yuzu Chuhai?</h2>
         <p>Chuhai is a cocktail containing the <strong>Japanese alcohol called 
         <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/shochu/">shochu,</a> soda,</strong> and <strong>any kind of fruit juice.</strong> In Tokyo area we 
         sometimes call it Sour instead of Chuhai. This cocktail is 
         very popular in Japan, commonly served in izakaya-style 
         restaurants and restaurants that cater to Japanese salary 
         workers. This Chuhai contains <strong>yuzu juice</strong>, a
         juice made from the yuzu citrus fruit. Valued for its aromatic
         and flavorful juice and rind, it is commonly used in many aspects
         of Japanese cuisine.</p>

        <h2>The History of the Chuhai</h2>
          <p>It's believed that the Chuhai originated in Eastern 
              Tokyo after the war, most likely in the Hikifune 
              neighborhood of Shumida City in Tokyo. Sanyu Sakabar 
              near the Keisei Hikifune Station claims to be the 
              birthplace. Still around today, the Chuhai rivalry in 
              the neighborhood remains strong with several shops 
              making the same claim.</p>
