    <h2 class="title">What is the Margarita?</h2>
      <p>The Margarita is a famous cocktail consisting of <strong>
          tequila, orange liqueur</strong>, and <strong>lime juice
          </strong> often served with salt on the rim of the glass. 
          It is often served shaken with ice.</p>

    <h2 class="title"t>The History of the Margarita</h2>
      <p>Some say that the Margarita was invented in 1938, when a 
          Mexican restaurant owner mixed it for Ziegfeld showgirl
          Marjorie King. Supposedly, tequila was the only alcohol
          that Marjorie would abide, so the restaurant owner added
          lime juice and salt. However, there are many different
          stories and no one knows its true origin.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Ingredients:</h2>
      <p>(makes <strong>1</strong> margarita)</p>
      <ul>
          <li>1 1/2 oz silver tequila</li>
          <li>1 oz orange liqueur</li>
          <li>3/4 oz freshly-squeezed lime juice</li>
          <li>ice</li>
          <li>lime wedge and coarse salt for rimming the glass <em>(optional)</em></li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="title"t>Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Salt the rim (optional).</strong> Run a lime wedge (the juicy 
              part) around the top rim of your serving glass. Fill 
              a shallow bowl or plate with salt, then dip the rim 
              until it is covered with your desired amount of salt. 
              Set aside.</li>
          <li><strong>Make the margarita mix.</strong> Add tequila, 
            orange liqueur, lime juice and a few ice cubes to a 
            cocktail shaker. Cover and shake vigorously for about 
            10 seconds. Give the mix a taste and stir in a teaspoon 
            or two of sweetener if desired.</li>
          <li><strong>Serve.</strong> Fill the prepared serving glass 
            with ice. Strain in the margarita mix, garnish with a 
            lime slice, serve and enjoy.</li>
      </ol>
