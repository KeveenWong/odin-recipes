    <h2>What is the Mimosa?</h2>
      <p>Mimosa is a classic breakfast cocktail that transforms a 
          simple morning meal into a decadent event. The cocktail is 
          made with <strong>freshly squeezed orange juice</strong> 
          and <strong>champagne</strong> or any <strong>dry sparkling 
          wine.</strong> Grand Marnier or bitters can also be added 
          in order to elevate the flavors even further.</p>

    <h2>The History of the Mimosa</h2>
      <p>Originally, mimosas were not a brunch cocktail at all. They 
          were called Champagne oranges and were a popular drink in 
          French wine country. The British royals brought the beverage
          back to England, where it became known as the mimosa, and 
          pretty soon, notable Europeans were drinking the beverage. 
          A few prominent American bars picked up the drink and it u
          ltimately came to be associated with brunch, along with its 
          partner in crime, the bloody Mary.</p>
