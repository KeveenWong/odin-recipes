## The Odin Project: Recipes

This is a project where I am to build a basic recipe website with:

1. images of the dish, 
2. the ingredients required to prepare  it, and 
3. the steps required to make it.

This will teach me the basics of making a website using HTML, as well as further familiarize myself with Git, repos, and commits.
